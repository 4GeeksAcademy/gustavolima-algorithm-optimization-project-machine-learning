# Algorithm Optimization Project for Machine Learning
<!-- endhide -->

Optimization of Algorithm in Machine Learning is a very important task to perform on any code. Machine Learning can be very expensive resource wise, especially working with very big data sets, plus if you have unoptimized code leaking a lot of memory. Hence the importance of writing good optimized code, to save on memory for other tasks as supervised learning and modeling. 

## ðŸ“’  Key Takes

For this project, the most important requirement is to understand how Python works and have good knowledge of the Python good practices such as PEP 8 to optimize your code not just for the sake of readability but also in terms of performance. Tools such like PyLint can help you to an extent, but it's key to understand how memory is addressed when coding Python and the dynamics of memory allocation in Computer Science. 

From a messy code, this was the outcome, where I measure the time of execution of code, which is a good measure to understand how fast it executes. Normally the faster a code executes the more optimized it is. So key take, always spend time optimizing your code.
