The system has the ability to add books to the library, lend books to readers, and receive books back. In addition, it can also list all the books available in the library.\n","\n","The problem is that the system is very slow and needs to be optimized. Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas of improvement and rewrite parts of the code to make it more efficient. Specifically, you are asked to perform the following improvements (update the below code and implement the following points):\n","\n","1. Identify and improve the data structures used to store books in the library and borrowed books. *Hint: Use an `set` instead of a `list` to store books in `Library.books` and `Library.borrowed_books` to make it more efficient to check if a book is present.**\n","\n","2. Avoid errors that could occur when attempting to borrow or return a book that is not present. *Hint: Use the `set.discard()` method instead of `list.remove()` in `Library.borrow_book()` and `Library.return_book()` to avoid errors if the book is not present.*\n","\n","3. Improve the efficiency of selecting a random book to lend or return. *Hint: Instead of selecting a random book from `Library.books` or `Library.borrowed_books` by indexing (which involves a conversion to list which is expensive), you can convert these sets to lists only once before the cycle.*\n","\n","4. Improve the efficiency of the function that lists all the books available in the library. *Hint: Instead of printing each book one by one in `Library.list_books()`, you can construct a complete string with all book titles and then print that string once.*\n","\n","5. Avoid repeated calls to `len()` in the body of loops.\n","\n","6. Use list comprehension to improve efficiency of book creation.. *Hint: Use list comprehension for book creation, which can be faster than using a for loop and repeatedly calling `Library.add_book()`.*\n","\n","7. Optimize checking the availability of borrowed books before attempting to return them. *Hint: Avoid checking `if library.borrowed_books:` before attempting to return a book. If you use sets and the `discard()` method, there is no need for this check.*"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21bcb8c4","metadata":{},"source":["#### Read and update the following given code:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"8467465b","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Book 2\n","Book 7\n","Book 11\n","Book 14\n","Book 15\n","Book 17\n","Book 18\n","Book 19\n","Book 20\n","Book 22\n","Book 25\n","Book 26\n","Book 28\n","Book 31\n","Book 32\n","Book 38\n","Book 39\n","Book 41\n","Book 43\n","Book 44\n","Book 45\n","Book 46\n","Book 49\n","Book 50\n","Book 51\n","Book 53\n","Book 54\n","Book 55\n","Book 64\n","Book 65\n","Book 66\n","Book 68\n","Book 69\n","Book 71\n","Book 72\n","Book 73\n","Book 76\n","Book 77\n","Book 79\n","Book 80\n","Book 81\n","Book 82\n","Book 84\n","Book 85\n","Book 86\n","Book 90\n","Book 91\n","Book 92\n","Book 95\n","Book 97\n","Book 23\n","Book 98\n","Book 100\n","Book 12\n","Book 93\n","Book 47\n","Book 16\n","Book 37\n","Book 48\n","Book 4\n","Book 74\n","Book 40\n","Book 56\n","Book 87\n","Book 89\n","Book 24\n","Book 9\n","Book 27\n","Book 42\n","Book 10\n","Book 59\n","Book 61\n","Book 5\n","Book 83\n","Book 58\n","Listing took 0.00010442733764648438 seconds\n"]}],"source":["import random\n","import time\n","\n","class Book:\n","    def __init__(self, id, title, author, pages):\n","        self.id = id\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.author = author\n","        self.pages = pages\n","\n","class Library:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.books = {}\n","        self.borrowed_books = {}\n","   \n","    def add_book(self, book):\n","        self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def borrow_book(self, book_id):\n","         book = self.books.pop(book_id, None)\n","         if book:\n","             self.borrowed_books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def return_book(self, book_id):\n","        book = self.borrowed_books.pop(book_id, None)\n","        if book:\n","            self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def list_books(self):\n","        return \"\\n\".join(book.title for book in self.books.values())\n","\n","\n","# Create a library\n","library = Library(\"Codeville\")\n","\n","# Add some books\n","library.books = {i: Book(i, f'Book {i}', f'Author {i}', i*10) for i in range(1, 101)}\n","\n","# Borrow some books\n","book_to_borrow = [library.borrow_book(random.choice(list(library.books))) for _ in range(50)]\n","\n","# Return some books\n","book_to_return = [library.return_book(random.choice(list(library.borrowed_books))) for _ in range(25) if library.borrowed_books]\n","\n","# List all the books\n","start_time = time.time()\n","print(library.list_books())\n","end_time = time.time()\n","\n","print(f'Listing took {end_time - start_time} seconds')"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"011996bc","metadata":{},"source":["## Exercise 2: Task Management System Optimization\n","\n","You are provided with code that simulates a task management system.
